      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. student in philosophy at [University Name], currently in my third year. 
        My work focuses on metaphysics, formal logic, and the philosophy of language. 
        Iâ€™m especially interested in topics related to grounding, logical form, and metasemantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also committed to teaching and communicating philosophy clearly and rigorously. 
        This site contains information about my research, teaching, and academic background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of philosophy, I enjoy cooking, exploring languages, and working with emerging tools in AI and academic workflows.
